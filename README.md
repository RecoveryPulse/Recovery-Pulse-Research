# Recovery-Pulse-Research
Recovery Pulse Reference implementation framework for smart contract recovery.

Research and provision of a reference implementation framework for smart contract recovery â€“with a focus on smart contracts used in non-financial applications.  

This reference implementation is be made up of multiple recovery mechanisms (based on our research into existing, robust implementations), including a novel concept and architecture we call: Recovery Pulse.  

This project aims to provide a new, UX-friendly way of doing smart contract and/or account and/or data recovery on the Ethereum blockchain and by extension, any EVM chain.
